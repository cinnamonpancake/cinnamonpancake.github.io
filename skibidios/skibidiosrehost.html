            <p>SKIBIDIOS WAS NOT MADE BY ME, IT WAS MADE BY https://github.com/averagedebianuser</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is a rehost of the unmodified SkibidiOS image, as the original link to SkibidiOS was taken down for unknown reasons. I'd highly suggest only running this in a virtual machine because I don't know what this image actually contains.</p>

            <p>(If you're averagedebianuser reading this, contact me on my discord <b>cinnamonpancake</b> if you want me to take this mirror down or if you want to explain why you took yours down cause your OS was funny even if very gen alpha)</p>
